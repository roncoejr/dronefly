Geeking out with a little deconstructing of a drone controller and basic UI

## Objective


## Background

## Overview

Got a Tello drone quite some time ago.  One day I had a need to inspect the roof of my home.  No way I was going to brave the climb up a ladder as my house is very tall.  Then, I remembered: I've got a drone I've never used.  Unboxed it.  Did the inspection.  Got hooked on the experienced.

Shorthly thereafter wondered what it would take to build my own control interface.
